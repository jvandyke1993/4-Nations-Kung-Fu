                <h3>Bagua Zhang - Air Bending Style</h3>
                <h4><strong>Main Benefit - Health & Peace</strong></h4>
                <p>
                    Bagua Zhang literally means "eight trigram palm" referring to the trigrams of the I Ching. 
                    It is often grouped as an internal practice. 
                    The practice of circle walking is Baguazhang's characteristic method of stance and movement training. 
                    All forms of Baguazhang utilize circle walking as an integral part of training. 
                    Practitioners walk around the edge of the circle in various low stances, facing the center, and periodically change direction as they execute forms. 
                    For a beginner, the circle is six to twelve feet in diameter. 
                    Students first learn flexibility and proper body alignment through the basic exercises, then move on to more complex forms and internal power mechanics. 
                    Although the internal aspects of Baguazhang are similar to those of Tai Chi Chuan, they are distinct in nature.
                    <br><br>
                    In our style of Bagua Zhang we include many soft style qi gong exercises along with meditative practicices to promote a healthy body, mind, and immune system. 
                    This is the most basic style and is suggested for anyone who may struggle with more complex and fast paced movements. 
                    By the time one reaches the final level in this course they will have mastered the deer horn knives and the bo staff weapons and will be familiar with acupuncture and energy healing techniques.  
                    Upon reaching level 4 of this course one should be proficient enough with mental and physical agility to move on to another style.

                <h3>Tai Chi Chuan - Water Bending Style</h3>
                <h4><strong>Main Benefit - Balance & Concentration</strong></h4>
                <p>
                    Tai Chi Chuan is an internal Chinese martial art practiced for defense training, health benefits, and meditation. 
                    Many forms are practiced, both traditional and modern. 
                    Most modern styles trace their development to the five traditional schools including the four we teach here: Chen, Yang, Wu, and Sun. 
                    All trace their historical origins to Chen Village. 
                    The concept of Taiji, in contrast with wuji ("without ultimate"), appears in both Taoist and Confucian philosophy, where it represents the fusion or mother of yin and yang into a single ultimate represented by the yin-yang symbol. 
                    While tai chi is typified by its slow movements, many styles (including three taught here: Yang, Wu and Chen) have secondary, faster-paced forms. 
                    Our school also teaches partner exercises known as pushing hands, a partner form, and martial applications of the postures of each of the forms.
                    <br><br>
                    In our style of Tai Chi Chuan this is the second level of style difficulty and is suggested for anyone who may struggle with extreme flexibility and strength but is confident in their ability to take on a normal level of activity such as biking, jogging, or swimming. 
                    By the time one reaches the final level in this course they will have mastered the foundations of the spear and will be familiar with basic chiropractic techniques.  
                    Upon reaching level 4 of this course one should be proficient enough with  balance, strength, and coordination to move on to another style.

                <h3>Hung Gar - Earth Bending Style</h3>
                <h4><strong>Main Benefit - Strength & Power</strong></h4>
                <p>
                    Hung Gar is a southern Chinese martial art belonging to the southern Shaolin styles. 
                    The Hallmarks of Hung Gar are strong stances, notably the horse stance and strong hand techniques notably the bridge hand and the versatile tiger claw. 
                    Traditionally, students spent anywhere from several months to three years in stance training, often sitting only in horse stance from half an hour to several hours at a time, before learning any forms. 
                    Each form could then take a year or so to learn, with weapons learned last. 
                    In current times, this mode of instruction is considered impractical for students, who have other concerns beyond practicing kung fu. 
                    Hung Gar is sometimes mis-characterized as solely external - that is, reliant on brute physical force rather than the cultivation of qi - even though the student advances progressively toward an internal focus.
                    <br><br>
                    In our style of Hung Gar, we include many hard style qi gong exercises including forms of body conditioning and strength training exercises. 
                    This is the third level of style difficulty and is suggested for anyone who is looking for a way to drastically increase their physical strength and power. 
                    One who takes this course should be rather healthy and prepared for a real workout every time they step on the mat. 
                    By the time one reaches the final level in this course they will have mastered the fundamentals of the sword and will be familiar with Traditional Chinese Herbal Medicine.  
                    Upon reaching level 4 of this course one should be strong, rooted, and confident, ready to move on to a more difficult style.

                <h3>Northern Shaolin Long Fist - Fire Bending Style</h3>
                <h4><strong>Main Benefit - Flexibility & Endurance</strong></h4>
                <p>
                    The Northern Shaolin style of kung fu is one of the most prominent traditional northern styles of Chinese martial arts. 
                    The northern styles of kung fu generally emphasize long range techniques, quick advances and retreats, wide stances, kicking and leaping techniques, whirling circular blocks, quickness, agility, and aggressive attacks. 
                    Northern styles exhibit a distinctively different flavor from the martial arts practiced in the South. 
                    In general, the training characteristics of northern styles put more focus on legwork, kicking and acrobatics. 
                    The system teaches empty-hand techniques and weaponry through predetermined combinations, known as forms, routines, or movement of sets. 
                    The students learn the basics by practicing the routines until the movements in the routines can be executed naturally based on instinct. 
                    Then, two or multiple man sets are practiced to train responses and applications of techniques learned from the sets. 
                    The practice sets/routines are not only practical in applications but are also graceful and artistic in nature. 
                    The fluidity of the movements combined with acrobatic techniques are trademarks of the Northern Shaolin sets.
                    <br><br>
                    In our style of Northern Shaolin Long Fist this is the most difficult of the four styles we offer in our school and is only suggested for those who posses a high level of strength, balance, and health. 
                    By the time one reaches the final level in this course they will have mastered the foundations of butterfly knives and the kwan do, and will be familiar with basic massage therapy techniques.  
                    Upon reaching level 4 of this course one should be in tip-top shape and able to move onto any other style with ease.
